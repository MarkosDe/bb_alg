Interactive proof assistants are a powerful tool in the hands of mathematicians, students
and anyone interested in constructing proofs and verify their correctness. Lean is a new,
open source programming language and tool for formalizing mathematical proofs. In this
project I use Lean to implement Buchberger’s Algorithm and the Buchberger criterion. To
develop the implementation I used preexisting definitions from Lean’s library mathlib and
added some background mathematics including the S-polynomial and Long Division for
multivariate polynomials
